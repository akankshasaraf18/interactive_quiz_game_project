This interactive quiz game features a dynamic multiple-choice question format designed to engage users and test their knowledge. The game presents each question with a set of clickable answer choices and includes a 15-second countdown timer to add urgency and excitement. If the timer runs out, users are prompted to either restart the quiz or end it. The quiz tracks the user's score, increasing it for each correct answer and providing immediate feedback with alerts for both correct and incorrect responses. At the end of the quiz, the user's total score is displayed along with a completion message. Navigation is facilitated by a "Next" button, which changes to "Play Again" once the quiz is completed, allowing users to easily restart the game. The game starts with a "Start" button, which initializes the quiz and displays the first question. Throughout the quiz, selected answers are highlighted, and the timer resets for each new question.
